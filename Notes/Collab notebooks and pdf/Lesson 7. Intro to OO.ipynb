    "# Intro to OO (object orientation)\n",
    "* As we have seen, in addition to code reuse and implementation hiding, functions allow to perform decomposition. For small programs decomposition into functions is usually enough to have a clear and easy to modify code. \n",
    "\n",
    "* But when working with complex programs decomposition into functions is not enough, we need to perform an extra level of decomposition: we don't usually put all the code in a single file, but divide it among several ones. There will be many files where functions are declared and a *main* file where the functions are invoked. This allows to have several people working on the same program and also makes programming easier.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Each of these files is usually called a *module*\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two criteria that can be used to group functions into modules:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Grouping the functions by functionality: functions that perform similar tasks are put together. As an example, in the final project we would create a module for all the functions moving characters, another one for functions drawing things, another for functions checking collisions and so on. This is known as **structured programming** or **modular programming**: functions are grouped into modules taking into account what they do.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Grouping functions by the entity they refer to. In the final project we would put together all the functions related to our plane. Everything related to shots will go together. Another module would contain all the functions related to the enemies. Another one could contain all the functions related to the board and so on. This is known as **object oriented** programming (OO).\n",
    "\n",
    "* OO can be seen as an evolution of structured programming, but it is a different approach: we focus on entities/objects that are relevant. In OO we put together not only the functions that are related to the same entity but also the variables related to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the final project we would use a module to put all the variables and functions related to the plane, another for the enemies, etc. In OO:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* each module is called a *Class*\n",
    ">* variables characterizing each object inside a class are called *attributes* or *fields*\n",
    ">* functions related to an object are called *methods*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advantages: OO provides a clear modular structure, easier to maintain because of the modular design and easier to be reused (this can also be obtained with Structured, but OO makes it easier)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Following an OO approach we analyze the problem in terms of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tEntities that appear in our problem (classes/objects)\n",
    "2.\tCharacteristics of those entities or information we need to store related to them (data attributes or fields)\n",
    "3.\tThings that those entities can do (methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is known as encapsulation (variables + methods operating on them): we put together data and functions working over them. OO is also inheritance and polymorphism (we'll see them later in this topic)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classes\n",
    "* As a first approach a class can be seen as a kind of generic dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Remember the 3 dictionaries *mike*, *peter* and *maria* of exercises of a previous week. Even if their structure is equal we need to define them 3 times\n",
    "\n",
    "* A class is like an skeleton to create objects: it is like a generic definition of the variables (which we will call attributes or fields) and the functions (which we will call methods) that an object will have. In other words, a class is a generic definition of all the objects of a given type.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  A whole program will have two different kinds of 'programs': classes where fields and methods of the objects are defined and implemented, and a main program where objects belonging to those classes are used to build the algorithm. We define classes and work with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To define a new class we use `class NameOfTheClass:`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Naming conventions for class names: upper camel case (see in the above line an example of a correct class name)\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is recommended to put the class in its own file, do not use the same file for different classes nor include any other function in that file\n",
    "* Once the class is defined I need to add attributes and methods to it. For the attributes the recommended way is to use a special method named the `init` method.* It is recommended to put the class in its own file, do not use the same file for different classes nor include any other function in that file\n",
    "* Once the class is defined I need to add attributes and methods to it. For the attributes the recommended way is to use a special method named the `init` method.\n",

Its header will be `def attribute(self, value)` and it must be decorated with `@attribute.setter`. Inside this method I should check that the type of `value` is correct and also that its value is correct. If they are not right, exceptions will be raisen. If the value is correct I will assign it to the attribute, but instead of doing `self.attribute = value` I must prepend two underscores to the name of the attribute: `self.__attribute = value`.

It must have also the name of the attribute and will receive only `self` as parameter (`def attribute(self)`). It must be decorated with `@property` (exactly like this). In this special method all I can do is to return the value of the attribute adding two underscores before the name of the attribute: `self.__attribute`.
